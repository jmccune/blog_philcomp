### Scala ###

Scala:

 - Benefits:
   - Scalable (& fixes some things from Java)
     + everything is an object (including functions)
     + immutablility abounds and is a cornerstone
   - Can expand/extend the language defining operators.
   - Composition using traits (mixins)
   - Concise
   	 + Type Inference
