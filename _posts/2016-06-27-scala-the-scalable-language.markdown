### Scala ###

Scala:

 - Benefits:
   - Scalable (& fixes some things from Java)
     + everything is an object (including functions)
     + immutablility abounds and is a cornerstone
   - Can expand/extend the language defining operators.
   - Composition using traits (mixins)
   - Concise
   	 + Type Inference


Note: 
    - after having talked with a few users of Scala, it's apparently the right job for certain things, but not a replacement for java.
    - (e.g. it has its own set of problems-- kotlin developers for instance didn't care for how long it took to compile)
